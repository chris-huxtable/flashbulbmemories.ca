Flashbulb Memories began in June 2014 when I built my first photo booth as a wedding gift for my sister. It was a simple wooden affair built around a polaroid camera, but the booth was an enormous hit with the guests. Wanting to share the nostalgic joy of photo booths with others, I founded Flashbulb Memories soon after.
