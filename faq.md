#What are 'idle hours'?

If you want to split up your rental hours with a break in the middle, you can purchase idle hours at a lower rate. Let's say you're organizing a wedding. You want the booth to be running during cocktail hour as well as during the dancing afterward, but you don't want it to be running during the dinner when no-one will be using it. No problem! Just purchase idle hours for during dinner, and we'll pause the booth until your guests are ready for more photo time!

#Do you charge extra for delivery / set-up / tear-down?

Nope! Delivery, installation, and teardown are all included in the standard rental price. We think you should pay only for what you are using.

---

#What is the maximum amount of time I can purchase?

It depends on when your event starts. Our hours of operation are listed on our info page, and you can purchase additional time within these hours. Exceptions may be made for multi-day events or other special requests - drop us a line and we'll see what we can do!

---

#Can you customize a package for my event?

We will do our best to accommodate custom requests - if you would like to see Flashbulb Memories at your next event, please contact us to see what we can do for you. Depending on your request we may be able to offer special pricing, additional features, or extended travel. We would be glad to talk with you about your event and come up with a quote.

#Are printouts included in the price?

Yes! Most packages includes 200 prints as standard, while our fundraiser packages feature unlimited prints. Additional prints can also be purchased on the spot. If you are expecting many guests or to use more than 400 prints, please let us know beforehand so we can stock adequate consumables.

---

#Do I need to put down a damage deposit?

Yes. We require a $200 damage deposit at the time of booking, paid via cheque or credit card authorization. We will take photographs of the booth prior to the event start in order to assess any damage incurred during the event. Please see our rental agreement for more details.

---

#How long in advance do I need to book?

At least 14 days is preferred, but if you call the day before and we are available then we will happily come to your event! Please note that bookings made less than 14 days in advance are non-refundable if cancelled, and a credit-card authorization or cheque needs to be provided to us at the time of booking.

---

#How much space do you need?

The booth requires an area of at least 3x4 metres to set up - preferably as close to an electrical outlet as possible. If props and costumes are requested, you will need to provide some tables to spread them out on. If you aren?t sure whether the booth will fit, contact us and we can discuss your venue.

---

#Will there be someone there to keep the booth running smoothly?

Of course! All rentals include a pair of booth attendants to keep things running smoothly and help your guests have a good time. Need us to blend in? No problem: let us know the theme or dress code of your event and we will dress to match!
